# Forecasting-NHS-Admissions-using-Markov-Chains-Model
For an organisation to plan effectively, it is essential that it can in some way anticipate the future. This project uses ten years of historical NHS A&amp;E admission data to predict the next ten years of A&amp;E admissions flow, using the Markov chain model. This can enable hospitals to make the necessary decisions in effective hospital management.

# Objectives
The overall goal of this project is to contribute to the research on predicting patience admissions in the NHS.
This project specifically aims to use ten years of historical NHS A&E admission data to predict the next five years of A&E admissions, using the Markov chain model. 
This can enable hospitals to make the necessary decisions in effective hospital management. 

# Methodology
This paper is structured into 6 main parts, using the cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM), a 1996 methodology created to shape Data Mining projects.
Firstly, Project Understanding: The initial phase of this project focuses on understanding the requirements of the project and setting goals to meet the requirements. Secondly, the Data Understanding phase: After understanding the requirements of this project, we then convert that knowledge into data sourcing.
The data preparation phase covers cleaning, formatting, combining, analysing, and visualising the data set. In the modelling phase, various modelling techniques are explored, and the Markov Chain technique is selected. During the evaluation phase, the Markov chains model is reviewed to ensure it properly achieves the objective. We then measured predictive performance using the Monte Carlo uniform distribution and considered how this changed in different scenarios of admissions data. Finally, during the deployment phase, the knowledge gained from this project will be presented in a way that is useful to the NHS.

# Key Findings
This project attempts to accurately forecast the next ten years of NHS admissions, using historical data. The predicted results were compared to the actual results of the ten years of historic data, and we observed an average of 6.27% in-accuracy. This reveals that admissions are not so unpredictable, except for a fluke in the year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
